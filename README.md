# React tabs app

## Usage

```js
import { Tabs, Pane }  from './Tabs'

//...

<Tabs index={0}>
  <Pane label="Tab 1">
    <div>
      The stretching story awakes the ten sabotage. On top of the bonus results the solid earth. Should whatever substitute parade hum? How can the ally listen?
    </div>
  </Pane>
  <Pane label="Tab 2">
    <div>
      Can the saga underline his jargon? The outline rots past an eyesight! When can a developed thief starve on top of a temper? A climbing crew hardens. When can a forbidden attorney orbit her crying beloved? A theological changeover spites a wrong fence.
    </div>
  </Pane>
  <Pane label="Tab 3">
    <div>
      The soup tacks the privileged roundabout. A paragraph inspects the quota. The chamber tailors whatever accumulated grandmother. The teenage strips away an airport over the permanent typewriter. The garden features a twisting trouser inside the riot.
    </div>
  </Pane>
</Tabs>
```
